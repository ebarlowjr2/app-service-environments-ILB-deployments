# App Service Environment Deployment

This reference implementation shows how you can improve the resiliency of an ASE deployment by deploying in multiple availability zones. The standard deployment is also covered. For more information about this scenario, see the reference architecture: [High availability enterprise deployment using App Services Environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/enterprise-integration/ase-high-availability-deployment)

## TODO

[] Make sure you delete secrets

## Prerequisites

- [azure-cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) 2.37.0 or newer.

* [sqlcmd](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup-tools?view=sql-server-ver15) installed.

* **jq** tool installed for your platform:
  `sudo apt-get install jq`

* **dig** tool for your platform - Check that you are able to get the public IP, and install dig tool:
  ```
  sudo apt install dnsutils
  dig @resolver1.opendns.com ANY myip.opendns.com +short
  ```

## Set up environment variables to run the deployment script

Run the following commands after providing values for the variables.

**Note:** RGLOCATION should be in the right format. Some examples of valid locations are **westus, eastus, northeurope, westeurope, eastasia, southeastasia, northcentralus, southcentralus, centralus, eastus2, westus2, japaneast, japanwest, brazilsouth**.

```
export RGNAME=yourResourceGroupName
export RGLOCATION=yourLocation
export SQLADMINUSER=yoursqlAdminUser
export JUMPBOX_USER=yourJumpBoxUser
export ADMIN_USER_ID=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)
```

## Enter and export the password for the SQL Server administrator

**Note:** For SQL Server administrator password requirements, check [Password Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/password-policy?view=sql-server-2017).

```
read -s SQLADMINPASSWORD
export SQLADMINPASSWORD
```

## Enter and export the password for the jumpbox administrator

```
read -s JUMPBOX_PASSWORD
export JUMPBOX_PASSWORD
```

## Enter and export the password for the SSL certificate

```
read -s PFX_PASSWORD
export PFX_PASSWORD
```

## Run the deployment script

Move to templates directory.

```
cd templates
```

Then follow the steps for either standard or high availability deployments.

### For standard deployment

```
chmod +x deploy_std.sh
./deploy_std.sh
```

### For high availability deployment

```
chmod +x deploy_ha.sh
./deploy_ha.sh
```

## Insert Document in Cosmos Db

1. After deployment ends in the last step, run the following commands to get the resourceURl

```
echo "{\"id\": \"1\", \"Message\": \"Powered by Azure\", \"MessageType\": \"AD\", \"Url\": \"${RESOURCE_URL}\"}"
```

The following snippet shows an example of the JSON response:

```
{"id": "1","Message": "Powered by Azure","MessageType": "AD","Url": "https://webappri.blob.core.windows.net/webappri/Microsoft_Azure_logo_small.png"}
```

2. Open Azure portal, navigate to the resource group of the deployment, and click on **Azure Cosmos Db Account**.

- Select **Firewall and virtual network**, there you can see:  
  **Add IP ranges to allow access from the internet or your on-premises networks**. 
  Click on **Add my current ip**, and save it.
  In Exceptions section below, check the "Allow access from Azure Protal" option.

- From Cosmos Db Data Explorer, Select **cacheContainer**, then click on **Items**. Click on **New Item**. Replace the whole json payload with above content and click **Save**.

- Go to Azure portal and open the resource group of deployment above. Click on **Azure Cosmos Db Account**, then select **Firewall and virtual network**, then delete your public ip.

## Register domain by adding a record in hosts file [OPTIONAL]

1. Go to Azure portal, open the the resource group of deployment above, and click on **AppGatewayIp**, then copy the IP Address value.
2. Edit local host file.
3. Add a new record using the IP read in step 1 above with the domain defined in APPGW_URL.

## Set up managed identities as users in the Sql Database

[Create SQL server MSI Integration](./create_sqlserver_msi_integration.md).

## Publish Asp.net core Web, Api and Function applications

1. [Prepare Jumpbox](./prepare_jumpbox.md).

2. [Compile and Deploy Applications](./compile_and_deploy.md).

3. At this point you should be able to test the application:  
   8.1 For standard deployment, open: https://votingapp-std.contoso.com.  
   8.2 For high availability deployment, open: https://votingapp-ha.contoso.com.
